# lem_in

a Hive (42 school) project.

Algorithm project to calculate maximum flow in minimum time.

"Your ant colony must move from one point to another. How do you do it in the shortest time possible? This project will get you acquainted with graph traversal algorithms: your program will have to intelligently select paths and precise movements used by the ants."

## What I learned

- Theory and application of Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp algorithms.
- Hash table creation and usage.
- Optimization of code for faster execution.
- Team-work.

## How to use

Make the executable:
```
make
```

run the executable with a .map -file of your choosing, for example:
```
./lem-in <
